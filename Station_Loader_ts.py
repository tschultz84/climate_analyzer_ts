"""
This object has functions to identify the station nearest to a reference lat, lon.
It then downloads the data from the climate station closest to this lat lon.
It then runs several checks on this data to see if it is acceptably complete, which you can infer from the input variables. 
It also calculates the TMID values, which is the average of TMAX and TMIN in every day.

#The outputs of interest are as follows:
    self.refpoint is the reference
    self.station_information gives meta information, like the station name, ID, lat/lon, etc.
    self.station_filters summarizes all the filters you entered as inputs. 
    self.closest_stations gives a list of the  nearest stations
    self.station_data is a numpy array ahving loaded all the station's data, a numpy array 
     with these columns: [Year, Month, Day, Day of Year, TMAX, TMIN, TMID]

    The inputs are as follows:
    *point is a list, in the form [latitude,longitude], which is the reference point 
        (data will be loaded for the station closest to these coordinates where enough data
        is available.)
    *printupdate, is only used to display status updates for the script.If false, no updates are printed
    *min_days_per_mo is the minimum number of dasys of data which must be present for every month of a year for 
        a dataset to be included. If not, then the year is excluded from dataset.
    *search_radius is the lat/lon degrees around the reference piont that are searched. Defaults to 1, meaning 
        a searched is performed within 1 degree north, south, east, and west, of point.
    *firstyear is the earliest year which must be present in the dataset record for the weather station
        to be loaded. (Note: The station must have data for the 2nd most recent year, i.e., in 2022, for 2021.)
    *basenoyears is the number of years in the baseline period.
    *min_recent_years is the minimum number of years before he present which must be present
        for the statin to be loaded.
    *required_trend_years minimum number of years in the last 30 required to calculate this trend.
        Weather stations without this many years present in the last 30 years of data will be discarded.
    *lastbaseyear is the last year in which the baseline is calculated (not the same as last year)
