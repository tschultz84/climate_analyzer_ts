#This YAML file contains all the drop flags elements and row ordering
#needed to load .dly files.

 #This allows you to read .dly files, which are fixed width filesn. It generates the column number dividers 
 #needed to read the file. THis is all based on the following documentation.
 #See https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt

#As default, the "flag" columns wont be imported. NOAA has a long set of 
#columns which are "data flags" which signal if a data point is suspect for some reason
#or another.
#I included them for completeness, so you can load flags if you wish.

#This array contains the number of columns, if they are imported with no flags

#DIRECTORIES AND FILE LOCATIONS

#STATIONMETA is the file containing all the lat / lon information for the stations.
    STATIONMETA : "C:\\ts_big_data_files\\ghcnd_station_master_ts_tmax.csv"
    
#NOAA_URL is the url to the directory containing the DLY files.

#HARDCODED PARAMETERS
    #BASEYEAR is the year before which station data must be availbale. 
    #stations with no data prior to this year are not loaded. 
    BASEYEAR : 1970
    
    #BASENOYEARS is the number of years included in the baseline period. 
    BASENOYEARS : 30
    
    #RECENT_TREND_YEARS is the number of years included (starting from the final year in the dataset).
    #in the annual temperature average trendline.  The linear trend is calculated only over this period.
    RECENT_TREND_YEARS : 30
        
    #REQUIRED_TREND_YEARS is minimum number of years required to calculate this trend.
    REQUIRED_TREND_YEARS : 25
    
    #MIN_DAYS_PER_MO is the minimum number of dasys of data which must be present
    #for every month of a year for a dataset to be included.
    # If not, then the year is excluded from dataset.
    MIN_DAYS_PER_MO : 20
    
    #ALPHA is the alpha value cmoparing TMID in the reference and baseline period. 
    #Basically if the P Value from the corresponding t-test exceeds this value,
    #then a change is deteced.
    ALPHA : 0.01
    
    
    #This is the lat/lon distance within which weather stations are serached.
    #This is used to streamline how fast the "closest station" function works. 
            #stations are only sorted by distance if they rae within +/- coord_radius
            #of the reference point. 
    SEARCH_RADIUS : 3
